* ***FRAMING THE PROBLEM***

I've a dataset of 28666 animes and I've to build an Anime Recommendation System and deploy it on website.

* ***GATHERING DATA***

I've fetched data from Jikan API, which is an unofficial API of MyAnimelist.


* ***TECHNIQUE USED***

I am going to use Content-Based filtering, in which recommendation is decided on the basis of content they like.

* ***EVALUATION METRICS***

PASS

* ***ASSUMPTIONS***

Since the data is missing 90% english titles, we're assuming that people will know the japanese name of animes.
